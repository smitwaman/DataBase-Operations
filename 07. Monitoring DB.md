Monitoring hardware resources parameters of a database server is crucial for ensuring optimal performance and stability. Here's how you can monitor various hardware resources parameters in detail and dump logs for each:

1. **CPU Usage:**
   - Monitor CPU usage using tools like `top` or `htop`.
   - Dump CPU usage logs periodically using a command like:
     ```
     sar -u 1 10 > cpu_logs.txt
     ```

2. **Memory Usage:**
   - Monitor memory usage with tools like `free` or `vmstat`.
   - Dump memory usage logs periodically with a command like:
     ```
     sar -r 1 10 > memory_logs.txt
     ```

3. **Disk I/O:**
   - Monitor disk I/O with tools like `iostat` or `iotop`.
   - Dump disk I/O logs periodically with a command like:
     ```
     sar -b 1 10 > disk_io_logs.txt
     ```

4. **Network Usage:**
   - Monitor network usage with tools like `iftop` or `nload`.
   - Dump network usage logs periodically with a command like:
     ```
     sar -n DEV 1 10 > network_logs.txt
     ```

5. **Database Connections:**
   - Monitor database connections using database-specific commands or queries.
   - Dump database connection logs periodically with a command like:
     ```
     SELECT * FROM mysql.general_log WHERE event_time > NOW() - INTERVAL 1 DAY;
     ```

6. **Database Query Performance:**
   - Monitor query performance using database-specific monitoring tools or query profiling.
   - Dump query performance logs periodically with a command like:
     ```
     SHOW FULL PROCESSLIST;
     ```

7. **Database Locks and Blocking:**
   - Monitor locks and blocking using database-specific commands or queries.
   - Dump lock and blocking logs periodically with a command like:
     ```
     SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS;
     ```

8. **Database Error Logs:**
   - Monitor database errors using database-specific error logs.
   - Dump error logs periodically by viewing the error log file:
     ```
     cat /path/to/error_log_file
     ```

9. **Database Slow Query Logs:**
   - Monitor slow queries using database-specific slow query logs.
   - Dump slow query logs periodically by viewing the slow query log file:
     ```
     cat /path/to/slow_query_log_file
     ```

By monitoring these hardware resources parameters and dumping logs periodically, you can gain insights into the performance and health of your database server, enabling you to detect and troubleshoot issues more effectively
